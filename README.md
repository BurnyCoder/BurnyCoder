I'm, Interesed in everything around AI engineering and research.

# State of the art
- I am interested about the current state of the art top artificial Intelligence systems (machine learning, data science, statistics, deep learning, generative AI (large language models, image/sound/video models, multimodal models), reinforcement learning models, expert systems, neurosymbolic AI, etc. I want to use them in practice for the benefit of others, such as for automating mundane tasks (dishes, laundry), healthcare (AMIE, AlphaFold, SLIViT), programming (coding AI copilots such as GitHub copilot, [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), Replit, and autonomous software engineers), science (autonomous science), physics (FermiNet), mathematics (AlphaProof), technology development (AlphaChip, virtual reality), chatbot assistants grounded in reality, education, information searching, minimizing various risks and crises, transportation, manufacturing, security, cybersecurity, energy optimization, supply chain optimization, weather forecasting, agriculture, translation, recommendations, finance, call centers, entertainment, legal services, games, robotics for good, altruism, etc. by predicting, forecasting, generating, classification, analysis, clustering, segmentating etc., with AI engineering methods by building and training models, finetuning, prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation, agent and multiagent frameworks, etc. using PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn, FastAI, OpenAI or Anthropic API, Llama locally or deployed, Llamaindex, Langchain, Autogen, LangGraph, vector databases, etc. ([Courses - DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/), [Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/), [Stanford CS229: Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNyWOpJg_Yh4NSqI4Z4vOYy))

# From scratch
- I am interested in how to build good AI models from scratch in PyTorch, or not from scratch with for example finetuning. I enjoy building large language models and other deep learning models from scratch. With PyTorch, Keras, fastai, etc. (I really love [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero by Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) that was in OpenAI and Tesla and thaught in Stanford)
  
# Mathematical and other fundamentals, steerability
- I am interested in trying to mathematically and empirically understand current and future AI systems, why and how they work, and how to make them much more reliable, robust, steerable, creative, intelligent, safe etc. across all levels of their development! Better steering wheel for AI systems would be great! RLHF, prompt engineering, systems made of LLMs, and current reverse engineering methods don't seem to be enough! Mechanistic interpretability, neurosymbolic AI, weak to strong generalization paradigm, and formal verification sound promising! ([A Comprehensive Mechanistic Interpretability Explainer & Glossary - Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J))
  
# Benefits, risks, impact and future of AI and humanity
- I want to see AI applied much more in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, healthcare, altruistic usecases, etc. I want to see it as a tool that generates abundance for everyone. I want the technology to build better future for all. I want the technology to fight poverty and other world problems and risks. I want the research to help understand the nature of intelligence. I want the technology to empower all humans that don't want to see the world burn or are not dictators. I want the power of it be used for good. I want the power to not be concentrated. I want to see it developed safely and ethically in steerable way. I want people to get compensated properly. I'm trying to push that and help to work towards these goals more! AI can be used for both bad, good, and neutral things. Let's maximize the good usecases!
- I am interested in the future, with a focus on the future of AI, but not just the state of the art of the technology itself, but what implications does it have for our system in terms of politics, culture, economy, governance, other technologies, etc. In general I think about how to make world better for everyone with increasing automation. How can it go well and have positive impact on our future? What political changes will we have to do? What risks exist? Where can we make the most beneficial progress? I don't want to see people suffer, maybe something like universal basic income or universal basic services will be needed to catch up with lob loss with increasing automation, so that technology generates abundance for the benefit of all, not just for select few? How to minimize power concentration in the hands of the few? I'm trying to find solutions! I really care about the future filled with a ton of free fulfilled sentient beings flourishing, instead of dystopias and catastrophes! I post a lot about it on my [Twitter](https://x.com/burny_tech) to around 20 000 followers. 

And many other things, see my website [burnyverse.com](https://burnyverse.com/).
