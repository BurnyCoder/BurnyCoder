Hi! I'm interested in everything around AI engineering and research.

### Questions I explore the most

- How does the world work? How does everything work?
- What is the fundamental equation of intelligence? What are all the different types of all the possible current and future intelligent systems?
- What is the fundamental equation of the universe? What are all the equations, and mathematical structures more generally, governing reality across all scales in physics, and in natural science more generally?
- What is the state of the art in artificial intelligence mathematical theory and practice?
- How to apply AI for reverse engineering equations behind everything? How to apply AI for good as ideally as possible as much as possible?
- How to define and build artificial general intelligence and superintelligence?
- What is the fundamental equation of the brain? How to upgrade human intelligence?
- How does AI and biological intelligence compare? How can humans and AIs form even greater collective intelligence?
- What is the fundamental equation of creativity in science and art? How to make machines creative beyond human limitations and comprehension for scientific discovery, physics, mathematics, art, philosophy?
- How to connect all sciences, formal and natural? What is the fundamental equation behind emergence and complexity? How does biology and other scientific fields emerge from physics and chemistry?
- What are all the concepts in mathematics? What are all the possible foundations and mathematics with all sorts of mathematical universes and which ones are the best in what contexts?
- What is the fundamental equation of consciousness?
- How to make the world better for all?
- What is the fundamental equation of building a great future for all where everyone flourishes? How to maximize the benefits, and minimize the disadvantages, of technologies and political systems? What is and what will be the geopolitics of AI? What are the probabilities of different future scenarios?
- What are the answers to the problems in philosophy?

### State of the art
- I am interested in the current state of the art top artificial Intelligence systems (machine learning, data science, statistics, deep learning, generative AI (large language models, image/sound/video models, multimodal models), reinforcement learning models, expert systems, neurosymbolic AI, etc. I want to use them in practice for the benefit of others, such as for automating mundane tasks (dishes, laundry), healthcare (AMIE, AlphaFold, SLIViT), programming (coding AI copilots such as GitHub copilot, Cursor, Replit, and autonomous software engineers), science (autonomous science such as AI scientist), physics (FermiNet), mathematics (AlphaProof), technology development (AlphaChip, virtual reality), chatbot assistants grounded in reality, education, information searching, minimizing various risks and crises, transportation, manufacturing, security, cybersecurity, energy optimization, supply chain optimization, weather forecasting, agriculture, translation, recommendations, finance, call centers, entertainment, legal services, games, robotics for good, altruism, etc. by predicting, forecasting, generating, classification, analysis, clustering, segmentating etc., with AI engineering methods by building and training models, finetuning, prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation, agent and multiagent frameworks, etc. using PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn, FastAI, OpenAI or Anthropic API, Llama locally or deployed, Llamaindex, Langchain, Autogen, LangGraph, vector databases, etc. 

### From scratch
- I am interested in how to build good AI models from scratch in PyTorch, or not from scratch with for example finetuning. I enjoy building large language models and other deep learning models from scratch. With PyTorch, Keras, fastai, etc. (I really love [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero by Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) that was in OpenAI and Tesla and thaught in Stanford)
  
### Reverse engineering
- I am interested in trying to mathematically and empirically understand current and future AI systems, why and how they work, and how to make them much more reliable, robust, steerable, creative, intelligent, safe etc. across all levels of their development! Better steering wheel for AI systems would be great! RLHF, prompt engineering, systems made of LLMs, and current reverse engineering methods don't seem to be enough! Mechanistic interpretability, neurosymbolic AI, weak to strong generalization paradigm, and formal verification sound promising! I'm curious about the mathematical theory of artificial intelligence!

### Big picture
How does artificial intelligence (and intelligence more generally) that might soon become very general and superintelligent, works from an interdisciplinary lens using all sorts of mathematics and methodologies from computer science, statistics, information theory, physics, mechanistic interpretability, cognitive science, geometry, pure mathematics and so on, what is the mathematical theory of artificial intelligence? How to mathematically and empirically understand current and future AI systems, why and how they work, and how to make them much more reliable, robust, steerable, creative, intelligent, safe etc. across all levels of their development, such as with formal verification? What are the current state of the art results and methods in AI engineering and research in academia and industry, such as mathematical results, empirical results, and tools used like PyTorch? What will be future developments in scaling, data, algorithms, architecture, hardware, wrappers, agents, multiagent systems, etc.? How good in what usecases are various AI paradigms such as statistical AI, connectionist AI with deep learning, symbolic AI, neurosymbolic AI, evolutionary AI, cognitive AI, bayesian AI, biologically-inspired AI such as neuromorphic AI, quantum AI, embodied AI, distributed AI, etc.? How can we merge different paradigms? What would be considered as Artificial General Intelligence and Superintelligence? How to define, measure and build intelligence? How much does AI safety play a role? What is the intersection of artificial intelligence x biological intelligence x collective intelligence? How to create theory of everything in intelligence?
