I'm, Interesed in everything around AI engineering and research.

- I am interested in how to use the current state of the art [[artificial Intelligence]] systems ([[machine learning]], [[Large language model|large language models]], [[data science]], [[statistics]],â€¦) in practice for the benefit of others, such as for [[Artificial Intelligence#Crossovers|automating]] mundane tasks (dishes, laundry), [[Artificial intelligence x Science|science]] ([[AlphaFold]]), physics ([[FermiNet]]), [[Artificial Intelligence x Mathematics|mathematics]] ([[AlphaProof]]), [[Artificial intelligence x Healthcare|healthcare]], [[Artificial Intelligence x Engineering|technology]] development, [[Artificial intelligence x Programming|programming]] (autonomous software engineers), preventing various [[risks]], [[chatbot]] assistants grounded in reality, etc. with [[Llamaindex]], [[Langchain]], [[Autogen]], [[Vector database|Vector databases]], etc. ([Courses - DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/), [Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/), [Stanford CS229: Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNyWOpJg_Yh4NSqI4Z4vOYy))
- I love all sorts of [[AI tools]] for [[productivity]] and other usecases, I love using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) with IMO the best [[AI copilot ]]out there for [[programming]], or [Replit](https://replit.com).
- I am interested in how to build good AI models from scratch in [[PyTorch]], or not from scratch with for example [[finetuning]]. I enjoy building large language models and other [[deep learning]] models from scratch. With [[PyTorch]], [[Keras]], [[fastai]], etc. (I really love [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero by Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) that was in [[OpenAI]] and [[Tesla]] and thaught in [[Stanford]]) 
- I am interested in trying to [[Mathematical theory of artificial intelligence|mathematically]] and [[Mechanistic interpretability|empirically]] understand current and future AI systems, why and how they work, and how to make them much more [[reliable]], [[robust]], [[mechanistic interpretability|steerable]], [[Creativity|creative]], [[intelligence|intelligent]], [[Artificial intelligence safety|safe]] etc. across all levels of their development! Better steering wheel for AI systems would be great! [[Reinforcement learning from human feedback|RLHF]], [[prompt engineering]], [[agents|systems made of LLMs]], and current [[reverse engineering]] methods don't seem to be enough! [[Mechanistic interpretability]], [[neurosymbolic AI]], [[weak to strong generalization]] paradigm, and [[formal verification]] sound promising! ([A Comprehensive Mechanistic Interpretability Explainer & Glossary - Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J))
- I am interested in the [[future]], with a focus on the [[Benefits, risks, impact and future of AI and humanity|future of AI]], but not just the state of the art of the [[technology]] itself, but what implications does it have for our system in terms of [[politics]], [[culture]], [[economy]], [[governance]], other technologies, etc. In general I think about how to make world better for everyone with increasing [[automation]]. How can it go well and have positive impact on [[Future of humanity, AI, sentience, futurology, politics|our future]]? What political changes will we have to do? What [[risks]] exist? Where can we make the most beneficial [[progress]]? I don't want to see people suffer, maybe something like [[universal basic income]] or [[services|Universal basic services]] will be needed to catch up with [[lob loss]] with increasing [[automation]], so that [[technology]] generates [[abundance]] for the benefit of all, not just for select few? How to minimize [[power concentration]] in the hands of the few? I'm trying to find solutions! I really care about the [[future]] filled with a ton of free fulfilled [[experience|sentient]] beings [[flourishing]], instead of [[dystopia|dystopias]] and [[catastrophe|catastrophes]]! I post a lot about it on my [Twitter](https://x.com/burny_tech) to around 20 000 followers. ([[Future of humanity, AI, sentience, futurology, politics]])
